//! Authkestra is a modular authentication framework for Rust.
//!
//! This crate serves as a facade, re-exporting functionality from other `authkestra-*` crates
//! based on enabled features.

/// The engine: `Engine`, the auth methods, the flows, the token machinery
/// and the stores.
///
/// This is the *only* name the facade gives `authkestra-engine`. It used to
/// also be re-exported as `flow` and `token`, from when `authkestra-flow` and
/// `authkestra-token` were separate crates (RFC-001, since merged into
/// `authkestra-engine`). Those aliases outlived the crates they were named
/// after: all three resolved to the same crate, so `authkestra::flow::` handed
/// you the token and session machinery too, and `token` was gated on
/// `feature = "token"` while re-exporting everything that feature does not
/// cover. Both are gone — reach any of it through `core`.
#[cfg(feature = "engine")]
pub use authkestra_engine as core;

/// Session, token and credential stores, plus the memory/Redis/SQL backends.
///
/// A short path to [`core::store`]; which backends exist inside it is decided
/// by the engine's own feature gates, not re-gated here. The gate is the set
/// of storage backends — it was previously `feature = "session"` alone, with
/// a *second* copy of the same module exported as `persistence` under a wider
/// gate, so which name worked depended on which feature you happened to
/// enable. The `session` feature itself no longer exists; the store traits
/// live in [`core::auth`] and are reachable without picking a backend.
