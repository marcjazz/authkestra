/// Verifies a device-bound signed request against the configured trust policy.
///
/// `request.signature` and `request.attestation` carry the two credentials (see
/// [`SignedRequest`]); this function is deliberately framework-agnostic so it can be called from
/// a `tower::Layer` (see the optional `axum` feature), a future authkestra trait-based
/// integration, or a plain test harness — the algorithm itself does not care which.
///
/// Order, and why it is load-bearing:
///
/// 1. **Presence** — both credentials must be present. An attestation alone is a bearer token
///    (it is public, travels in every request, and is likely logged); rejecting this case is
///    what keeps the attestation from becoming exactly the weaker-than-normal scheme this design
///    exists to avoid.
/// 2. **Parse + `alg` check** — for both credentials, cheap, before any cryptographic work.
/// 3. **Attestation trust** — issuer, `kid`, signature, expiry, device status.
/// 4. **The binding** — recompute the embedded `jwk`'s RFC 7638 thumbprint and compare it,
///    constant-time, to the attestation's `cnf.jkt`. **This is the step that cannot be inferred
///    from the other two.** An attacker holding a victim's attestation (public, not secret) and
///    their own genuinely-held keypair passes steps 3 and 5 independently and completely; only
///    this comparison detects that the two credentials describe different keys. Skipping,
///    reordering, or short-circuiting it is a total authentication bypass.
/// 5. **Request-signature verification** against that now-bound `jwk`.
/// 6. **Freshness** — skew window, maximum signature lifetime.
/// 7. **Request binding** — method, path, audience, query hash, body hash.
/// 8. **Replay** — recorded last, and fails closed on any store error, not just "already
///    present". A replay store that cannot be reached must reject exactly as if the `jti` had
///    already been seen; falling back to "allow" would silently disable replay protection during
///    an outage, which is worse than rejecting traffic.
