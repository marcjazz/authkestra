//! Issue #325: what the facade forwards, pinned from outside.
//!
//! The facade used to forward nine features while its sub-crates offered
//! roughly twice that. Passkeys, TOTP, captcha, every persistent store, the
//! OP server, device signatures and the `ActixState` derive were unreachable
//! through `authkestra`, so an application wanting any of them had to depend
//! on the sub-crates directly — which defeats the point of a facade, and is
//! why the documented advice was to skip it.
//!
//! # Why this lives in its own crate
//!
//! `crates/authkestra`'s own tests cannot check this. Its dev-dependencies
//! name the sub-crates directly, and Cargo unifies features across normal and
//! dev dependencies, so a sub-crate feature enabled there is on during the
//! test build whether or not the facade forwards it. An in-crate version of
//! this file passed with the forwarding entry deleted — confirmed by removing
//! `authkestra-engine/webauthn` from the facade's `webauthn` feature and
//! watching the suite stay green.
//!
//! This crate depends on `authkestra` and nothing else from the workspace, so
//! every path below resolves only if the facade genuinely forwarded the
//! feature. The feature list lives in `Cargo.toml`; there are no `cfg` gates
//! here, so a dropped or misspelled forwarding entry is a hard compile error
//! rather than a silently skipped test.
//!
//! Paths are named rather than values constructed: the assertion is
//! reachability, and constructing these types would drag in trait bounds that
//! have nothing to do with it. Each `use` sits in a named `#[test]` so a break
//! points at the feature that regressed.
