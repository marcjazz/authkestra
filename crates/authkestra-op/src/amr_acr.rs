//! `acr`/`amr` claim derivation for issued ID tokens (OIDC Core §2).
//!
//! `authkestra_engine::Engine::authenticate` is the only place that knows
//! which [`AuthMethod`](authkestra_engine::auth::AuthMethod) actually ran —
//! the primary one, and (if the caller completed one) a step-up. It has no
//! reason to know about OIDC claim vocabulary, so it stamps that fact onto
//! [`Identity::attributes`] instead, under the
//! [`IDENTITY_ATTR_AMR`](authkestra_engine::auth::IDENTITY_ATTR_AMR) /
//! [`IDENTITY_ATTR_STEP_UP_SATISFIED`](authkestra_engine::auth::IDENTITY_ATTR_STEP_UP_SATISFIED)
//! keys — the same established idiom `identity.attributes["nonce"]` already
//! uses to thread flow-local data through `Identity` without changing its
//! shape (see `authkestra_engine::flow::oauth2`). This module is the other
//! end: it turns those attributes into the two standard OIDC ID token
//! claims when an issued token's identity carries them.
//!
//! See `docs/rfc-006-acr-amr-claims.md` for the full design rationale.
//!
//! ## AMR value set
//!
//! `authkestra-engine`'s internal auth-method names (`"password"`, `"totp"`,
//! `"webauthn"`) are remapped to the wire values below, moving closer to the
//! IANA registry in RFC 8176 where a value already fits it exactly:
//!
//! - `"password"` → [`AMR_PASSWORD`] (`"pwd"`, RFC 8176's canonical token).
//! - `"totp"` emits **both** [`AMR_OTP`] (`"otp"`, the RFC 8176 registry
//!   term) and [`AMR_TOTP`] (`"totp"`, the specific one). `amr` is an array,
//!   so there is nothing to trade off: a relying party matching strictly
//!   against the registry — which off-the-shelf RP libraries commonly do —
//!   finds `"otp"` and recognises the factor, while a consumer that cares
//!   reads `"totp"` and learns what `"otp"` alone loses (not HOTP, not a
//!   mailed or SMS code). Emitting only the specific value would leave the
//!   strict matcher seeing a token that names no second factor it knows.
//! - `"webauthn"` stays `"webauthn"`: RFC 8176 has `"hwk"` (hardware key)
//!   and `"swk"` (software key), but this crate's WebAuthn integration
//!   doesn't distinguish a roaming authenticator from a platform one, so
//!   asserting either would overclaim what was actually verified.
//!   `"webauthn"` names the actual mechanism without guessing.
//! - [`AMR_MFA_MARKER`] (RFC 8176's own generic multi-factor marker,
//!   `"mfa"`) is appended whenever [`ACR_MFA`] applies (see below),
//!   mirroring how several production IdPs report both the constituent
//!   method(s) and this summary value together.
//! - Any other internal method name (a custom
//!   [`AuthMethod`](authkestra_engine::auth::AuthMethod) an integrator
//!   registered) passes through unchanged — this crate has no way to know
//!   what it should map to, and passing it through verbatim is more honest
//!   than dropping it.
//!
//! ## ACR scheme
//!
//! `authkestra-engine`'s step-up model is binary — primary auth, or
//! primary+step-up — so `acr` is too: exactly two self-issued URN values,
//! [`ACR_SINGLE_FACTOR`] and [`ACR_MFA`]. This is deliberately *not* a NIST
//! SP 800-63 AAL1/2/3 ladder or an eIDAS LoA scheme: this engine cannot back
//! a claim that specific (no phishing-resistance attestation, no identity
//! proofing tier, no re-authentication/`max_age` freshness tracking), and a
//! relying party parsing an AAL-shaped string that doesn't mean what AAL
//! means would be actively misled.
//!
//! An identity whose `attributes` carry no `amr` at all — e.g. one that
//! never passed through `Engine::authenticate` at all, such as a federated
//! login handed straight to `handle_authorize` — gets neither claim:
//! omitting `acr`/`amr` is legal per OIDC Core §2 (both OPTIONAL), and
//! asserting a scheme this crate has no evidence for would be worse than
//! saying nothing.
//!
//! ## `auth_time`
//!
//! Derived independently of `acr`/`amr` from
//! [`IDENTITY_ATTR_AUTH_TIME`](authkestra_engine::auth::IDENTITY_ATTR_AUTH_TIME):
//! "how recently did this user prove themselves" is a different question from
//! "with what", and OIDC Core §2 defines all three as separate OPTIONAL
//! claims. For a login that completed a step-up it is when the *step-up*
//! finished — the most recent proof, which is what a re-authentication gate
//! asking "prove it again within N seconds" actually needs.
//!
//! Because the value rides on the `Identity`, a token minted later by the
//! refresh-token or token-exchange grant reports when the user originally
//! authenticated rather than when that token was issued — which is what
//! `auth_time` is defined to mean, and the reason it is not simply `now()`
//! at issuance time.
//!
//! Enforcing freshness — honouring a `max_age` request parameter or
//! `prompt=login` — is deliberately *not* here; this is the observability
//! half. See issue #381.
