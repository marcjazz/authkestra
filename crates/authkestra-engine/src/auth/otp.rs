//! Email and SMS one-time codes.
//!
//! See `docs/rfc-011-otp.md` for the design record. It is the sibling of
//! [`magic_link`](crate::auth::magic_link), and the interesting part is where
//! it cannot follow it.
//!
//! Magic link stores its record under the hash of the secret, which is what
//! buys single use for free. A six-digit code cannot: a wrong code hashes to
//! a key that does not exist, so the server would have no idea whose code was
//! being guessed, could not count the attempt, and could not tell a typo from
//! an attack — while any guess colliding with *anybody's* live code would
//! succeed. So the challenge is keyed by **subject**, with the code's hash as
//! a value, and everything else here follows from that.
//!
//! Delivery stays the application's, exactly as for magic link: no transport,
//! no templates, no address book, and no way for this module to leak whether
//! an account exists, because it is never told. The one exception is the
//! channel, which the engine must know because RFC 8176 gives SMS its own
//! `amr` value and the engine cannot map what it was not told.
